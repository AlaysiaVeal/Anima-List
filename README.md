## **_Description_**

### My Goal is to create a fully functioning anime list where you can look through a catalog of anime/manga and add them to your list where you can rate them, delete off the list, or update the list.

## **_My Process_**

### First, I created my diagram so I can envision how it will turn out. Then I created my files such as the models and controllers for the backend work and I will create the files for the frontend such as the client folders with react dependencies.
